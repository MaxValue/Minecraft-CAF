#MINECRAFT CAF\*

*\*CAF stands for "citius, altius, fortius", the current olympic motto.*

##Explanation

I noticed that Minecraft (PC) mostly runs outdated libraries. Effects of this are more laggs, more bugs, less fun, less utilisation of computer hardware. In short: Minecraft does not do it's job that well.

But you can change that. Since the new launcher was born, settings are made more central and easier to customise. The launcher has the option to create different profiles with variable Minecraft versions. The settings for these profiles are stored in JSON-files. I already did the job for you and updated all profiles for all minecraft versions for you. What does this change, you ask? Minecraft now loads newer versions of the required libraries and runs overall better.

###TL;DR

Use the launcher profiles in this repository to speed up Minecraft.

##Important Note

**Use this at your own risk. Not every feature has been tested with these updated setting, but I'm working to change this. Beware.**
